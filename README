PolymorphicAttacher
===================

A relatively common headache in Rails (at least for me) is dealing with 
double-polymorphic associations through web forms. How one attaches, detaches parent/child nodes
becomes a messy endeavor.

This plugin is an attempt to encapsulate some easy to use functionality.
